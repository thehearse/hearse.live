# Useful NetBSD commands to get working installation with DWM

I might need this in the future, really don't want to figure it out again and it's good website-filler. Some things are done quite differently to freebsd and thanks to its smaller userbase it can be hard to get good search results. Here I present some notes I have taken over the course of time I have spent using NetBSD. Also just before we start, note my system specs and make changes to the commands accordingly. i5 6600 (4 cores); AMD RX 570; 8G of ram; no wifi card; B150M-D3H motherboard hence its ethernet. 

To avoid typing out all these commands, I made a script to automate them. But you can't have it. It's mine. All jokes aside, I haven't tested it and it would probably just break your installation. The contents, however, are more or less what you will find in this guide.

# To fix SSL errors with curl and git
	$ pkgin in mozilla-rootcerts
	$ mozilla-rootcerts install
# Good website to get sauce

# Get a good mirror
Or watch your computer download at the speeds of the 1980s. Most mirrors are pretty horrid... Anyways, you need to run these nice commands.

	 $ PKG_PATH="https://cdn.NetBSD.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/$(uname -p)/$(uname -r | cut -d_ -f1)/All"
	 $ export PKG_PATH
	 $ pkg_add -v pkgin
The following commands after having pkgin installed

	 $ mkdir -p /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin
	 $ touch /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf
	 $ vim /usr/pkg/etc/pkgin/repositories.conf
	 
The file repositories.conf has the a list of your mirrors. At the end of the file add the following:
**IMPORTANT!** Change the number after .../amd64/ to your version of NetBSD. In my case, I am using 9.1, so I will write in 9.1. Also note that **amd64 = x86_64**. Oh the names.

	http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/amd64/9.1/All/
	 
If you are using a different architecture to amd64, visit the website http://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/ in your browser and find your actual architecture and use its link that looks like the one above. Then export the same link like this:

	$ export PKG_PATH=‚Äùhttp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/pkgsrc/packages/NetBSD/amd64/9.1/All/

You can then install the pkgin package manager and use it from then onwards, your mirrors should work fine now. Remember to change the number when you upgrade to a new version of NetBSD.

	$ pkg_add -v pkgin
	$ pkgin update
# dwm won't compile
 This is to be expected, GNU/Linux and BSDs are different systems. Thankfully the suckless devs, [although apparently Nazis](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20845633), are really good programmers and only a few things will have to change.
 
	# cd dwm
	# make
	drw.c:5:10: fatal error: 'X11/Xlib.h' file not found
	#include <X11/Xlib.h>
	
If you've used dwm on freeBSD or openBSD, you may be used to changing the location of the X11R6 header files to *local* in the **config.mk** file. This file, located inside your dwm folder needs these variables changed, but in a way that is different to open and freebsd.

	Install freetype2, you will need it
	$ pkgin in freetype2

## Use this command to find the missing file.
	$ find / -type f -name Xlib.h
## NetBSD 
	X11INC = /usr/X11R6/include   -->  X11INC = /usr/X11R7/include
	X11LIB = /usr/X11R6/lib  --> 	X11LIB = /usr/X11R7/lib
	...
	FREETYPEINC = /usr/X11R7/include/freetype2
## FreeBSD
	X11INC = /usr/X11R6/include   -->  X11INC = /usr/local/include 
	X11LIB = /usr/X11R6/lib  --> 	X11LIB = /usr/local/lib
	...
	FREETYPEINC = /usr/local/include/freetype2
