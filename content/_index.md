## the hearse lives here
Fitter, happier, more productive, comfortable (not drinking too much). Regular exercise at the gym (3 days a week).   
  
 
Note that this is a fork / recycle of my old personal site. I did grep the living hell out of the web directory, but if I leak my name, well that would suck would it not.
