<p><a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/vegan">The article in question</a></p>
<p>Luke Smith, a relatively popular linux youtuber has decided to bless his loyal fanbase with his views about veganism, a topic I have long suspected him to to come ranting along about sooner or later. The vegan / meat eater debate, as I am fully aware, is a hostile environment and my goals are certainly not to mock, demean, or call anybody bad names. The problem with Luke’s argument is sadly that of ignorance and of, what appears to be deliberate lack of understanding the whole vegan position.</p>
<p>In this short article I will attempt to quickly go over the gist of his article and explain the most obvious errors Luke has made. I, however, encourage you to read the article yourself. I do not believe a single point made is actually factually correct.</p>
<p>The article begins with what appears to be a direct insult to his audience:<br>
<em>I&rsquo;ve accumulated a lot of subscribers that are variously nerds, furries, degenerates, coomers, libertarians, communists, trannies and among them are vegans. Some of them (I assume) are good people.</em></p>
<h1 id="bugmanism">Bugmanism</h1>
<p>Bugman, a term Luke seems to have excitedly included in his vocabulary of newspeak, is simply a term describing an individual who, as a product of modern decaying society, has become resillient to anything traditional, or rather inherited to him and decides to worship large companies and global trends. A faceless clone with a undying love for brand loyalty, Twitter and fad diets. Perfectly set in the hive-mind of today’s internet-set world.</p>
<p>Luke then somehow uses the term of bugmanism to simplify the idea of animal welfare to this very personality type. The argument being that veganism (or modernism in Luke’s example, which is quite obviously and later literally supposed to translate to the former) replaces “natural, emergent morals” with “controlled authorities”.</p>
<p>“Veganism forces one to abandon not just their own traditions, but every human dietary tradition and leaves them at the whims of processed grains and pharmaceutical supplements for a meager survival. “
&ndash; The reality, though, is quite not so simple. Reducing the idea of animal liberation to the “rejection of dietary tradition” is an unfair comparison. Veganism is not a diet! Veganism, to aptly quote means the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is the argument that using an animal for personal gain is wrong. This has nothing to do with tradition, nothing to do with rejecting the traditions passed down to you by your parents and most certainly hasn’t anything to do with a “controlled authority”. Which authority does Luke have in mind? You don’t have to suddenly despise your grandma’s recipes, you can enhance them and build on the essence of the meal to create one without the part you have an ethical problem with. There is also no requirement for a vegan to eat “processed grains” if they so choose. Under processed grains, however, would also fall flour, which is an essential part of any diet, however ancient it may be. The argument for veganism is that of ethics, the means you use to approach this theoretical ethical end goal are yours to interpret.</p>
<h3 id="some-funky-things">Some funky things</h3>
<p>“You cannot have a normal life and can’t dine with friends”. - If your friends are so limited in their liking of you, that they will not dine together with you because you choose a different food for reasons deeply important to you, are pretty horrible friends.</p>
<p>“You cannot hunt animals” – Yes, that is the whole point. You, however, are quite the hunter at your local butcher’s.</p>
<p>“You become a nag at war with your family, the world around you.” – Thank you for helping us be more included in the “normal” of our society.</p>
<h1 id="the-reasonable-of-vegan-for-health">The REASONABLE of &ldquo;Vegan for Health&rdquo;</h1>
<p>Meat is NOT nutritionally deficient, as Luke points out. It is high in cholesterol, saturated fat and heme iron though and it is highly unethical. Also, yes it is quite “convenient” for plants to be considerably healthier for human consumption. It is convenient for the animals who are the victim of our modern society. The very thing Luke seems to so vehemently oppose.</p>
<p>The Standard American Diet is not vegan and I have no idea of the reasoning Luke is attempting to put forward in this part of the article. Veganism is not a diet. You can eat McDonalds’ french fries, biscuits and ice tea and that would be a vegan “diet”. You are expected to be an intelligent human being able to put together a meal plan and keep yourself healthy.</p>
<p>Then follows a few unsubstantiated claims about vegans falling dead, which I will ignore for their absolute insanity.</p>
<h1 id="veganism-is-rational">Veganism IS rational.</h1>
<p>The comparison to other tragedies, such as the holocaust, or slavery are very controversial and Luke seems to understand this quite well. Thankfully he doesn’t draw any conclusions from the reality that some vegans compare the suffering of animals to the terrible acts mentioned. I myself avoid these comparisons, even though some Holocaust survivors have made them in the past. It is not a convenient image, but a sad reality of how we treat others, uncluding animals.</p>
<p>Luke then unbelievably makes the “Plants feel pain though” argument, which I will just ignore. How an educated, thinking human being writing a “rational” article has the ability to say that plants feel pain boggles my mind. Plants simply don’t. No nervous system, no brain = no pain. Luke, please.</p>
<p><em>Corporations started shilling vegetable oils (which originally were and frankly still are just industrial by-products) as workable replacements for butter and lard. Seventh-Day Adventists lobbied for them because of their own religion beliefs. Jews lobbied for them because they hate unkosher lard. Years later, now we know that vegetable oils are highly unstable and have contributed to the massive rise in heart disease.</em></p>
<p>– No, unstable plant oils have no contributed to the high rates of heart disease plaguing the modern world. This is simply a lie. Luke hasn’t provided any research for this, so I won’t bother at this time. I might add them later. Both lard and butter contain incredibly high amounts of saturated fat and trans fatty acids, directly linked to forming of plaque on the artherial walls. Come on, the most vehement meat eaters hate plant oils and margarine with a passion and they come out the worst. Let’s not make up lies. The majority of vegans I know follow a high-carb / low-fat diet. We do not eat margarine by the spoonfull.</p>
<h1 id="veganism-only-makes-sense-in-a-bugman-environment">Veganism only makes sense in a bugman environment.</h1>
<p>Here follows a talk about how “where Luke lives”, nobody would consider not eating an egg. How this translates to the modern human living in an urban environment with no access to eggs that would almost qualify as ethical, I don’t understand. People buy eggs at a supermarket, from a battery cage.
most Vegans are Vegans because they are softies who have literally no connection to animals whatsoever until as a teenager they watched a PETA documentary with chickens getting their heads buzzed off or pigs walking around in their own poop.
I would make the case that vegans have more of a connection to animals than any other group of people. It is quite literally the reason we go to such lengths as to not eat them. I have spent a lot more time with animals since going vegan and trust me, they all will end with their heads cut off and it is an incredibly disheartening thought. Fuck PETA, they don’t make docummentaries and nobody likes them. Not even vegans.</p>
<h1 id="animals-live-to-be-eaten">Animals live to be eaten.</h1>
<p>Yes, it would be unfortunate for us to destroy the environment of wildlife. That is your concern? A lot of land destruction is caused by freeing up space to farm crops for the mass-production of animals and their feed. Don’t pretend to care about the environment. It is just not simple like that.</p>
<p>The responses to “Dumb vegan sayings” I believe do not need any rebuttal. If you do need them explained, please read “Animal liberation”, or any other animal welfare book. It would be insulting to actually answer them.</p>
<h1 id="lets-just-laugh-at-this-for-a-minute">Let&rsquo;s just laugh at this for a minute&hellip;</h1>
<p>Cherrypicked vegan copypasta. This image is something I would expect to find on an anti-vegan facebook group. Nobody actually thinks this. There are amazing sources of protein on a plant based diet, broccoli is just not it and let’s lot pretend like anybody actually thinks so.</p>
<h1 id="noootruits-dont-actually-matter-anyway">Noootruits don&rsquo;t actually matter anyway</h1>
<p>Mimicking meat-based recipes is useful to recreate the flavors of the foods we have grown to love. We are not “replicating the nutrients”, because the nutrients we need are already in the plants. That is where the animals get them from too. It’s only natural and sensible to cut the middle-man.</p>
<p>Luke then quotes Sv3rige, an insane flat-earther with cannibalistic tendencies, who attempted to stab a few of his classmates and now runs a vegan-mocking youtube channel. I need not say any more.</p>
<p>Luke, you severely misunderstand the argument of veganism. Please read a book about animal welfare. The argument you have presented in your article are not founded in truth and only obvious ignorance reeks from within.</p>
