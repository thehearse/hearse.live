      <description>It is disappointing to see the sheer amount of hate, immaturity and discontent towards RMS in the recent return to FSF scandal. There is no Free software movement without Richard Stallman. You may not agree with everything he has ever expressed, but that is no reason to demand him to be put down. Discarding a man based on statements you disagree with, that have nothing to do with his message is dishonest and unbelievably disgusting. Please sign the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rms-support-letter/rms-support-letter.github.io&#34;&gt;RMS support letter&lt;/a&gt; to give Richard Stallman support.</description>
